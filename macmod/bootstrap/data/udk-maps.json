It is set aboard a Forerunner space station apparently in orbit around Threshold, as the planet is visible through the windows, as well as the moon Basis. It is cataloged by the UNSC as Deep-Space Anomaly #0198. It is a very small level that is best suited for 10 or fewer players, as more can become extremely chaotic unless that is the desired effect.",
